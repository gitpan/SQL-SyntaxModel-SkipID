Please note that no further development is planned for this module.  

Its reason to exist so far has 3 main aspects: 1. To preserve functionality
that was once developed in SQL::SyntaxModel and later stripped from it, for
historical posterity or for learning from; 2. To help test SQL::SyntaxModel
through its further development by exercising parts of it that other types of
tests didn't touch, including the ability to be sub-classed, and this allowed
me to expose bugs or design flaws in SQL::SyntaxModel a lot sooner; 3. to serve
as an example to future module or application builders on ways that
SQL::SyntaxModel can be used or extended.

While I may occasionally give attention to this module, such as to keep it
compatible with changes to the parent class and test said parent, I will mostly
be ignoring this module from now on.  The parent and some other users of it
will keep my attention instead.

Note that I forsaw this module's short life and intentionally gave it a name
which I thought other people would not want to use for a module themselves.

If you would like to make a new module of your own which conceptually replaces
this one, and does the job properly, then you have my blessing.  But please
tell me about it so I can add a reference to it.  You may also blatantly copy
any code from this module to your own, though I request to be credited.  Or
alternately, if you wish to become the primary maintainer of this actual module
with respect to CPAN, then please write me to arrange it (and credit me).
