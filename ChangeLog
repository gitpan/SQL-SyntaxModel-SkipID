	* Release 0.30.

	* From now on, SQL::SyntaxModel::SkipID and its primary distribution will
	have identical version/release numbers, to help avoid public confusion as
	to which distribution releases contain which SQL::SyntaxModel::SkipID
	versions.  This distribution's Makefile.pl now uses "VERSION_FROM =>
	'lib/SQL/SyntaxModel/SkipID.pm'" rather than "VERSION => N".  As such,
	SkipID.pm will always have its own version number incremented for any
	distribution changes, even if the changes are otherwise entirely in other
	files.  With this first such release, SkipID.pm is now at v0.30, up from
	v0.14 in the previous release.

	* Other new code file versions are: en.pm v0.05.

	* Updated external dependencies on Locale::KeyedText to v0.06 and on
	SQL::SyntaxModel to v0.40.

	* Updated all user-text strings in en.pm so that the module-class name
	appears at the start of each, to the left of the method names.  This should
	make it easier for users to know which code file among many candidates is
	generating any error messages they see.

	* Various small changes to ensure that SkipID.pm remains compatible with
	the latest SQL::SyntaxModel changes.  Also affirmed that SkipID.pm still
	passes the SQL::SyntaxModel test suite as a drop-in substitution for that
	module.  Also updated all SEE ALSO docs.
	
	* Renamed any calls on [with_all_nodes_]test_mandatory_attributes() to
	test_deferrable_constraints().
	
	* Updated _create_node_tree__do_when_parent_not_set() so it no longer
	throws an exception on failure to set a primary parent Node; the subsequent
	call to test_deferrable_constraints() in create_node_tree() would now
	perform the same assertion; removed the SSMSID_C_CR_NODE_TREE_NO_PRIMARY_P
	user message from en.pm.  Renamed the SSMSID_N_SET_AT_NREF_NO_ID_MATCH user
	message to SSMSID_N_SET_NREF_AT_NO_ID_MATCH.

	* Updated %NODE_TYPES_EXTRA_DETAILS in SkipID.pm for 'domain' Nodes so that
	there is no longer an 'attr_defaults' for 'char_enc'.  Before the change,
	SkipID.pm was adding a char_enc attribute to all domain Nodes, even those
	that were not the STR_CHAR; that behaviour was so very, very wrong.

	* Moved this distribution's t_*.pm file from the /lib directory to a new
	/t/lib directory, so that it doesn't pollute the user's install
	directories, and so the distribution is better organized on the whole.
	Added a "use lib 't/lib';" to SQL_SyntaxModel_SkipID.t in order to make the
	move work.  No changes to the tests themselves, except for any mentioned
	below here.  Updated the MANIFEST.

	* Updated t_SQL_SyntaxModel_SkipID.pm to transpose the 'domain' Node
	attributes 'num_precision' and 'num_scale'.  This actually corresponds to a
	SQL::SyntaxModel change made on 2004-04-10 with v0.16, but only just with
	v0.40 do SQL::SyntaxModel's constraints flag the SkipID.pm test data error.

	* Updated t_SQL_SyntaxModel_SkipID.pm to add 'char_enc' attributes to 6
	'domain' Nodes that needed them, since 'char_enc' no longer has a default
	value.  Also updated the expected output XML string to remove all of the
	'char_enc' from non-STR_CHAR domain Nodes.

2004-06-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 0.29.

	* Updated external dependencies on Locale::KeyedText to v0.04 and on
	SQL::SyntaxModel to v0.22.

	* This release is a small maintenance update to ensure that SkipID.pm (now
	v0.14) remains compatible with the latest SQL::SyntaxModel changes.  Most
	of the changes are in the test suite's set of input data and expected
	output data, but some changes were in the NODE_TYPES_EXTRA_DETAILS constant
	data in SkipID itself.  Beyond that, SkipID's API is identical to before.

	* Removed class property 'CPROP_HIGH_IDS' because it is now redundant with
	a new SQL::SyntaxModel feature; SkipID.pm code which used to set the old
	property was removed, and code which used to read it now calls
	SQL::SyntaxModel's get_next_free_node_id() method instead.  Changed methods
	are: Container.new(), Container.create_node_tree(),
	Node.create_child_node_tree().

	* Removed the long CONTRIVED EXAMPLE documentation section from SkipID.pm,
	which was redundant with the content of the test script/module files
	anyway, and seriously bloated the module.  Also updated the SYNOPSIS 
	documentation to point users to the script/module files for code examples, 
	rather than the now-removed documentation.  No other docs changes.

	* Following the above changes, SkipID.pm is now 38% smaller than before, 
	going from 45K down to 28K.

	* Added a 5th test to the test suite that explicitely makes sure that all 
	the mandatory attributes in the generated model are set.  SkipID.pm is 
	supposed to do this internally, but the test checks in case it doesn't.

2004-03-22   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 0.28.

	* There are 4 distributions being released simultaneously that all have the
	same release number of 0.28; this is one of them.  They are:
	SQL-SyntaxModel-0.28, SQL-SyntaxModel-ByTree-0.28,
	SQL-SyntaxModel-SkipID-0.28, Rosetta-0.28.  Each of the latter 3 is
	dependant on the first 1.  These 4 distributions cumulatively have almost
	identical contents to the Rosetta-0.27 distribution, which is their sole
	progenitor; that older distribution has hereby been split into 4 pieces
	which will now be developed independently from each other.  All 4 new 
	distributions inherit the external dependency on Locale-KeyedText-0.03.

	* While those of Rosetta-0.27 were taken as a starting point, these CPAN
	standard files have been changed to either a large or a small extent as
	appropriate so that they represent the new 0.28 distribution: ChangeLog,
	INSTALL, Makefile.PL, MANIFEST, ReadMe, TODO.  (META.yml is generated.)

	* This ChangeLog file has been truncated to exclude the details from
	releases 0.01 thru 0.27, as they aren't very useful going forward and take
	up a lot of space (about 90 kilobytes).  If you want to read those details
	then please look at an archived Rosetta-0.27 distribution, which is the
	last one to have them.

	* The distribution you are looking at now is the first one to bear the name
	SQL-SyntaxModel-SkipID.  For historical posterity, this is its file manifest:

		- ChangeLog
		- INSTALL
		- lib/SQL/SyntaxModel/SkipID.pm
		- lib/SQL/SyntaxModel/SkipID/L/en.pm
		- lib/t_SQL_SyntaxModel_SkipID.pm
		- Makefile.PL
		- MANIFEST
		- META.yml                                Module meta-data (added by MakeMaker)
		- ReadMe
		- t/SQL_SyntaxModel_SkipID.t
		- TODO

	* All modules with version numbers have seen theirs incremented by 0.01
	compared to Rosetta-0.27, and all modules or scripts that use them now
	require the new numbers; said modules did not have any other significant
	changes.  In this distribution, SQL::SyntaxModel::SkipID is now v0.13 and
	SQL::SyntaxModel::SkipID::L::en is now v0.04.

	* A few other minor updates were made to several files.

2004-03-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta-0.27, the last version of the distribution prior to its 4-way
	split, was released on CPAN.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta-0.02, the first version of the distribution under that name, 
	was released on CPAN.

2003-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* DBIx-Portable-0.01, the only version of the Rosetta distribution under
	its previous name, was released on CPAN.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the modules which became the pre-split Rosetta
	distribution as their own entity that is separate from my application, for
	open-source distribution on CPAN.  The modules were to comprise an
	RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.

	* Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

	* Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which added
	an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for each page
	request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl code.

2002-06-07

	* Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
	self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema, user
	interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost completely
	rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules for database
	communication and the web interface logic, with MySQL-specific code and
	database generic or data dictionary code in separate files, and separate
	files for parts of the web interface.  The program used the same generic
	CPAN modules as in the first prototype, DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

2001-11-24

	* Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

	* Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
	self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross between
	a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical or
	genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes of code
	that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's code, for
	database communication and web interface logic, was situated in a single
	module, with the rest of the program being more generic CPAN modules like
	DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

	* Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have something to
	start developing, testing and deploying database driven applications on.
